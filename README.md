# Convolutional gaussian processes

This package implements experiments around convolutional and deep gaussian processes.

This package uses the doubly stochastic deep gaussian process package which relies on not yet released features in gpflow. To install both of these packages run `sh ./init.sh`. This will initialize submodule and install both gpflow and the doubly stochastic deep gp package.

To install the rest of the dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

`main.py` implements experiments around mnist. `notebooks` contains code to analyze results.
